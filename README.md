## 1. What the Project Currently Is

This is a website that I built in around a day. It is for a web app I'm going to build that will live on the website in the future. It has a basic Home Page, About Page and Contact Page with working contact form.

## 2. What the Finished Project Will Be

I am planning on making a flash-card style web app with JavaScript that will have the following functionality:

- You're shown an image of a goose and options on what type of goose it is
- You select what type of goose you think it is
- You're told if you were right/what the right answer is
- If you click the 'next' button, you'll be taken to a new image

## 3. Technologies Used
