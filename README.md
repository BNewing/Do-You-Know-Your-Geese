## 1. What the Project Currently Is

So far, this is a website for a web app that I'm going to build. Once the web app is written, it will live on the website. It has a basic Home Page, an About Page and a Contact Page with a working contact form. I wrote the basic site in around a day.

## 2. What the Finished Project Will Be

I am planning on making a flash-card style web app with JavaScript that will have the following functionality:

- You're shown an image of a goose and options on what type of goose it is
- You select what type of goose you think it is
- You're told if you were right/what the right answer is
- If you click the 'next' button, you'll be taken to a new image

I'm also planning on adding in a page that shows different images and/or gifs of geese. I'm planning on using the Giphy API with this at some point.
